# Phase 4: Prototype Development and Ethical Evaluation
## Incremental prototype Development
- Developed our system as small unit in each step allowing testing and making necessary adjustments that might be needed. 
- Testing was done at each phase before proceeding to the next phase in the development.
- The ml model used data for a single lion making it easy to train and test the model on other wildlife.

## Secure coding practices
- added the .env file that contains credentials that should not be not be exposed to the public( GitHub).
- Form data is validated before processing.
- Handled error within our app (e.g use of the try-except block)
- Regular testing of code for security flaws.
