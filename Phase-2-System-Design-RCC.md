# System Design with Responsible Computing

## Privacy by Design

```python3
Integrates privacy measures into system architecture from the outset rather than as an afterthought.
```

We have implemented **Privacy as the Default Setting**, how?  We do not share any interporated data generated in model development. Only authorized people can access this data. In addition we know that the application is sensitive and prone to misuse, therefore during the development we kept the code and documentation private on github.

We only collected data of lions in Tsavo National park. This area is a hotspot to HWC therefore the need to collect and analyze data from lions in the region.

> Does the application comply with data protection laws such as GDPR, HIPAA, or Kenyaâ€™s Data
Protection Act.

## Security by Design

```python3
Ensures security is built into systems from the beginning rather than later. 
```

> Implement one of `OWASP` coding standards. That is, ***solve*** [Security logging and monitoring failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A09_2021-Security_Logging_and_Monitoring_Failures/). ***Idea - log the print statements in our functions into .log file***.
>
> Implement a strong auth mechanis to meet another OWASP coding standards ***solve*** [Identificaiton and Authentication Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A07_2021-Identification_and_Authentication_Failures/)
>
> Implemet `multi-factor-authentication` ***Idea - send confirmation codes to user email on registration***.
