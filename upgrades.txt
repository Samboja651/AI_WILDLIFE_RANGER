progress
-------
I created an email account "aiwildliferanger@gmail.com", use it for sending auth emails or alerts.
I updated the env to accomodate the new email. Also added the app password. 
I sent Zach the env file. App should work right with this env without modification.
I updated the db.users schema
Updated the route "/register" to store auth_code and status alongside credentials. line 105-110 of app.py
Updated the route "/login" to also fetch the auth_code, status and email. line 147, 151-154 of app.py
check the TODO on line 165 of app.py, thats your starting point, also refer to pseudocode 7.3.2
check spam if emails don't show up.
